# training-beyond-accuracy
A practical, exercise-driven introduction to core machine learning concepts using scikit-learn. Covers regression, classification, model evaluation (R², MSE, accuracy, F1, AUC), handling imbalanced data, pipeline construction, and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV — using real datasets (California Housing, Breast Cancer).
